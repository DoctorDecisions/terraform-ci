# Terraform CI Bot

This contains the Dockerfile configuration for the [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/) image
that supports our Terraform CICD flows.

# Important Notes

- The image repo is `473168162702.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/atlantis`
- This is NOT hooked up to CICD (yet), so you will need to push image updates to the repo manually
